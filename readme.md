## Install

```bash
npm install --save ow-shim
```

## Usage

There's no standard way to replace your usage of `ow` with `ow-shim` in production, but webpack's [resolve.alias](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias) config option works well.

Any `ow` statements will effectively be turned into no-ops.

You may also want to use this shim to cut down on browser bundle size.
